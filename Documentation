1. Purpose
This project is a simple library website allowing users to:
Register an account
Log in / log out
Reserve books
Un-reserve books
2. Technologies Used
PHP (backend)
MySQL or similar database (via db.php)
HTML + CSS for frontend
Basic session / authentication logic
3. Setup Instructions
Clone the repository.
Set up a local web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP) with PHP and MySQL.
Import or create the database schema (not documented here).
In db.php, update the database credentials (host, username, password, database name).
Place the project in the web server’s root (e.g., htdocs or www).
Access via browser, e.g., http://localhost/Library-Website/index.html.
4. File Structure (key files)
index.html — Welcome / landing page with links to login and registration. Login link points to http://localhost/webdev/lib/login.php. Includes a book animation element and welcome instructions.
registration.php — Handles user registration with form fields for username, password, repeat password, firstname, surname, address (line 1 & 2), city, telephone, and mobile number. Includes validation for duplicate usernames, password matching, password length (exactly 6 characters), and telephone/mobile number format (exactly 10 digits). Includes link to login.php at bottom of page.
login.php — Handles user login with session management and authentication. Redirects to login_homepage.php upon successful login. Includes link to reservation.php.
login_homepage.php — Main navigation hub; displays personalized welcome message when logged in (format: "[Capitalized-username], You have logged in successfully!" where the first letter of the username is capitalized using ucfirst()) and provides links to login, registration, reservation, and logout pages.
reservation.php — Book reservation interface with two search methods: (1) text search by book title, and (2) category dropdown search with 8 categories (Health, Business, Biography, Technology, Travel, Self-Help, Cookery, Fiction). Displays search results in a table format. Text search displays table headers: ISBN, Book Name, Author, Availability, option columns, but has a rendering bug in the table row output (reservation.php:51) where it displays ISBN, Book Name, Author, empty cell, Availability, Availability (duplicate), and then the Reserve/Reserved button. Category search displays: Cat ID (header label, but shows ISBN data), Book Name, Author, Availability, and Action columns. Note: There is a bug where the availability logic is inverted between text search (shows "Reserved" button when availability != 'N') and category search (shows "Reserve" button when availability == 'N'), resulting in inconsistent behavior. Search results are limited to 5 books per query. Includes link to view reserved books page (viewreg.php) and a back to homepage link (http://localhost/webdev/lib/login_homepage.php).
logout.php — Handles user logout and session destruction. Displays logout confirmation message ("You are now logged out.") with a "Continue" button that redirects to index.html.
db.php — Database connection file using mysqli_connect to connect to 'Bookdb' database on localhost with root user and no password. Includes error reporting configuration with display_errors enabled and error_reporting set to -1 (all errors). Outputs <pre> tag for formatted error display.
main.css — Styling for all pages including book animation, form elements, navigation links, headers, and footers.
viewreg.php — Displays the logged-in user's reserved books in a table format showing ISBN, username, and reservation date, with an unreserve button for each book. Includes a "Back to Home Page" button linking to http://localhost/webdev/lib/login_homepage.php.
usernotloged.html — Message page prompting users to log in before reserving books.
test_reserve_form.html — Testing/development file for book reservation functionality.
