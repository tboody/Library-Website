# Library-Website
The library website is connected to a database for storing user information and book details. Users can register, log in, and reserve/unreserve books. When users log in,
their credentials are checked against the database. Book availability is managed by updating the database when a book is reserved or unreserved by a user. The website's
functionalities, such as reservations and user authentication, rely on the interaction between the frontend interface (HTML/CSS) and the backend (PHP), which communicates 
with the database to perform these actions.
