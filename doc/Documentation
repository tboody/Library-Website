3. Setup Instructions
Clone the repository.
Set up a local web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, LAMP) with PHP and MySQL.
Create a database named 'Bookdb' and import the required schema (see Database Schema section below).
In db.php, update the database credentials if needed (currently set to: host='localhost', username='root', password='', database='Bookdb').
Place the project in the web server's root (e.g., htdocs or www).
Access via browser, e.g., http://localhost/Library-Website/index.html.
